My attempt of the Hateful Meme Detection Challenge:
<ul>
  <li>Task A is an exploratory data analysis of the objects detected in the memes and creates their catalog which also includes the race, sex and emotion of the humans detected</li>
  <li>Task B is an attempt to analyse the hindering impact of the captions in object detection in the images and uses different methods- TELEA inpainting, NS inpainting and cropping to remove the captions for a comprehensive analysis</li>
  <li>Task C uses 3 models- intermediate fusion of CLIP embeddings, RNN model and an MLP model which use BERT embeddings</li>
  <li>Task D is an analysis of whether NLP models are able to predict hatefulness by exclusion of the image modality</li>
</ul>

All results are presented in Analysis.pdf
